Project 3: Create a chatbot in Python
 Bookmark this page
Project Title: Create Chatbot in Python

Problem Statement: When using an app or website, customers expect outstanding service. They can become disinterested in the app if they can't locate the solution to a question they have. To avoid losing customers and having an adverse effect on your bottom line, you must provide the highest quality service possible while developing a website or application.

Project Steps

Phase 1: Problem Definition and Design Thinking

Problem Definition:The challenge is to create a chatbot in Python that provides exceptional customer service, answering user queries on a website or application. The objective is to deliver high-quality support to users, ensuring a positive user experience and customer satisfaction.

Design Thinking:

Functionality: Define the scope of the chatbot's abilities, including answering common questions, providing guidance, and directing users to appropriate resources.
User Interface: Determine where the chatbot will be integrated (website, app) and design a user-friendly interface for interactions.
Natural Language Processing (NLP): Implement NLP techniques to understand and process user input in a conversational manner.
Responses: Plan responses that the chatbot will offer, such as accurate answers, suggestions, and assistance.
Integration: Decide how the chatbot will be integrated with the website or app.
Testing and Improvement: Continuously test and refine the chatbot's performance based on user interactions.
Phase 2: Innovation

In this phase, consider exploring advanced techniques like using pre-trained language models (e.g., GPT-3) to enhance the quality of responses.

Phase 3: Development Part 1

Start building the chatbot by preparing the environment and implementing basic user interactions.

Phase 4: Development Part 2

Continue building the chatbot by integrating it into a web app using Flask.

Phase 5: Project Documentation & Submission

Document the project and prepare it for submission.

Documentation

Clearly outline the problem statement, design thinking process, and the phases of development.
Describe the libraries used and the integration of NLP techniques.
Explain how the chatbot interacts with users and the web application.
Document any innovative techniques or approaches used during the development.
Submission

Compile all the code files, including the chatbot implementation and web application code.
Provide a well-structured README file that explains how to run the code and any dependencies.
Include the dataset source and a brief description.
Share the submission on platforms like GitHub or personal portfolio for others to access and review.
